# composefs-oci

The high level goal of this crate is to be an opinionated
generic storage layer using composefs, with direct support
for OCI.  Note not just OCI *containers* but also including
OCI artifacts too.
    
This crate is intended to be the successor to
the "storage core" of both ostree and containers/storage.

## Design

The composefs core just offers the primitive of creating
"superblocks" which can have regular file data point
to underlying "loose" objects stored in an arbitrary place.

cfs-oci (for short) roughly matches the goal of both
ostree and containers/storage in supporting multiple
versioned filesystem trees with associated metadata,
including support for e.g. garbage collection.

## CLI sketch: OCI container images

`cfs-oci --repo=/path/to/repo image list|pull|rm|mount`

## CLI sketch: OCI artifacts

`cfs-oci --repo=/path/to/repo artifact list|pull|rm`

## CLI sketch: Other

### Efficiently clone a repo

`cfs-oci clone /path/to/repo /path/to/clone`
This would use reflinks (if available) or hardlinks if not
for all the loose objects, but allow fully distinct namespacing/ownership
of images.

For example, it would probably make sense to have
bootc and podman use separate physical stores in
`/ostree` and `/var/lib/containers` - but if they're
on the same filesystem, we can efficiently and safely share
backing objects!

### Injecting "flattened" composefs digests

Another verb that should be supported here is:
`cfs-oci --repo=/path/to/repo image finalize <imagename>`

This would compute the *flattened* final filesystem tree
for the container image, and inject its metadata into
the manifest as an annotation e.g. `containers.composefs.digest`.

Then, a signature which covers the manifest such as Sigstore
can also cover verification of the filesystem tree. Of course,
one could use any signature scheme desired to sign images.
